 * numbers, computed the same way, instead of the Sales page and the AI
 * silently disagreeing.
 *
 * Two different tables answer two different questions, and this deliberately
 * keeps them separate rather than papering over the gap:
 *  - `store_orders` (gross, ops-facing): every checkout, at the amount the
 *    customer paid, regardless of internal settlement — "how much came
 *    through, how many orders, what's selling."
 *  - `orders` (net, money-facing): the per-supplier slice of each checkout
 *    the wallet/settlement system has actually finalized
 *    (`credit_status = 'deducted'`) — "what you actually keep." A COD
 *    order's full subtotal is cash the supplier keeps, not the merchant, and
 *    an order still on hold (low wallet balance) hasn't been finalized at
 *    all — neither belongs in a merchant-facing "revenue" figure at face
 *    value, which is exactly the bug this replaces (the old Sales page and
 *    Co-Founder snapshot both summed `store_orders.subtotal` unconditionally
 *    and called it "Revenue").
