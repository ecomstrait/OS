/**
 * Write actions, gated behind human approval (Phase 5,
 * Docs/AI-Native-Migration-Plan.md).
 *
 * These tools never call `setShopifyProductPrice`/`setShopifyProductStatus`
 * directly — they only create a pending `ai_approvals` row and tell the
 * merchant a human needs to approve it. The actual Shopify write happens
 * only when someone resolves that approval as "approved" — see
 * `app/api/admin/approvals/[id]/route.ts`, the one place these two Shopify
 * functions actually get called with agent-proposed arguments.
