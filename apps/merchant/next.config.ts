// Storefront images come from two places:
//  - Product photos and store logos: this Supabase project's public storage
//    buckets, served from
//    `${NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL}/storage/v1/object/public/<bucket>/...`.
//  - Store media library uploads (blog cover images, and any hero/about/
//    gallery media picked from it) go through `/api/media`
//    (lib/media.ts), which uploads to Cloudflare R2 whenever it's
//    configured — a different host entirely (`R2_PUBLIC_URL`), falling back
//    to the same Supabase bucket only when R2 isn't set up. Both hosts need
//    a remotePattern, or `next/image` silently fails to render whichever one
//    is missing (this is what broke blog post cover images: R2 is
//    configured in production, but only the Supabase host was allow-listed
//    here).
